# Gold Box Explorer

A Windows File-like Explorer tool to view and export contents of classic "Gold Box" games, role playing games created by Strategic Simulations Inc. (SSI).

Gold Box games are games produced by Strategic Simulations Inc. (SSI) in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They have been a favorite amongst the Generation-X crowd for years and are still played to this day.

Gold Box Explorer is a labor of love and was created to decrypt and view information stored in the files for these games. This includes all Gold Box games created by SSI (Pool of Radiance, Curse of the Azure Bonds, etc.) and all files used and created by Unlimited Adventures (also known as Forgotten Realms: Unlimited Adventures or the acronyms FRUA or UA).
